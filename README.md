# telegram-memecoin-bot
A feature-packed Telegram utility bot for Solana memecoins utilizing multiple APIs to provide comprehensive information and trading tools.

## Notice
The source code will be published after I finish cleanup and fixing bugs, and will not receive future updates.  
I have lost interest in the project but would like to share it in a proper working state for others to use.

## Main Features
- Search for any Solana memecoin and get a real-time chart, detailed tokenomics information, and a comprehensive "rugcheck" risk assessment
- Highly configurable "Token Monitor" for alerting on brand-new memecoins that pass your custom filters. Automatic integration with the paper trading system can be enabled in config
- The token monitor can be setup in any channel, allowing you to configure automatic trading on supported platforms (ones that allow buying from Telegram messages - like Dexcelerate)
- Powerful wallet tracker - Add multiple wallets with optional labels, toggle real-time notifications, and receive alerts directly in Telegram
- (Beta) Fee Tracker - Discover new trading wallets by scanning for users utilizing specific transaction automation tools (i.e. Trojan)
- View detailed Profit and Loss statistics with visual graphs for any tracked wallet
- Paper Trading System to practice strategies without risking real funds
